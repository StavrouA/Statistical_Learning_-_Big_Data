# Statistical_Learning_-_Big_Data
This repository contains codes from my "Statistical Learning" course of my MSc. on Applied Economics.
I am providing pdfs with the questions as well as a complete pdf with my answers. 
The exercises are done in R, as well as PostgreSQL whenneeded. The codes provided granted me full grade (10/10).
The course taught is based on "Introduction to Statistical Learning", an introductory course on Machine Learning.
